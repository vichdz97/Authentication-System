    <h6>Why was this web application created?</h6>
    <p>
        As part of the Capgemini NGT Program, our team wanted to showcase how we could integrate our lessons from training 
        and additional technologies to create a full-stack web application.
    </p> 

    <h6>Do I have to create an account?</h6>
    <p>We highly recommend creating an account in order to access all the cool features that we have to offer.</p>

    <h6>I'm trying to create an account but there is already an existing account. What do I do?</h6>
    <p>Make sure to create a unique username and password! Remember to <strong>never</strong> share your login information with anyone.</p>
    
    <h6>Can I create more than one account?</h6>
    <p>
        Although not recommended, you can definitely create more than one account. 
        However, make sure your login credentials are unique to each account.
    </p>

    <h6>How can I update my username and/or password?</h6>
    <p>
        <i>For users:</i>
        Access your account and click on the yellow action button 
        <span class="text-warning"><i class="bi bi-pencil-square"></i></span>.
        You'll then be able to update your username, password, or both! 
        Just remember to store your new credentials in a safe place.
    </p>
